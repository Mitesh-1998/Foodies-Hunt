   cities for various purposes. They need some specific source of food. The people who shifted anywhere they can't afford 
   restaurants and hotels every day. It is difficult for the newly shifted person to find good nearby food service.
    On the other hand, food service providers face many problems of maintaining the record, informing the customer in emergency cases, 
    getting feedback from the customer and many more.<br/> Keeping all scenarios in mind the system customized according to a need of user and service providers.
    India in on line food market is yet in developing stage, Famous and big restaurants are listed and registered on line, 
    partnering with on line food order and delivery giants like zomato, food panda, swiggy etc.
     But when it comes to the small-scale and house-hold businesses like mess (inn), 
     the picture is different, especially in rural areas, mess operates completely off line!.
     The person there literally doesn't have a better option than to reach at particular mess and have a lunch or dinner there.
      So he/she would just have to compromise with the choices available.
